Explanation of the Parser
Tokenization:

The tokenize method uses regular expressions to tokenize the source code based on the defined grammar.
Parsing:

The parse method is the entry point for parsing the entire program.
The statement method checks the type of statement and calls the appropriate parsing method for control structures or expressions.
The if_statement, do_while_statement, for_statement, and method_declaration methods parse their respective constructs according to the grammar rules.
The expression and binary_expression methods handle expressions, including assignments and binary operations.
Error Handling:

The consume method checks for expected tokens and raises a SyntaxError if the token doesn't match.
Testing the Parser
The example Zara code provided tests various constructs, including if-else statements, a do-while loop, a for loop, and a method declaration. You can modify the zara_code string to test different scenarios, including valid and invalid syntax.

Valid and Invalid Test Cases

Valid Example:

zara
Copy code
if x = 10 {
    do {
        x = x + 1;
    } while x < 5;
} else {
    def foo(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
    x = x - 1;
}
Invalid Example:

zara
Copy code
if x = 10 {
    do {
        x = x + 1;
    } while x < 5
